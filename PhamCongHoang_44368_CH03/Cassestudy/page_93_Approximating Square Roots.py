Problem:Users of pocket calculators or Pythonâ€™s math module do not have to think about how
to compute square roots, but the people who built those calculators or wrote the
code for that module certainly did. In this case study, we open the hood and see how
this might be done.

Solution:
Compute the square root of a number.
1. The input is a number.
2. The outputs are the program's estimate of the square root
using Newton's method of successive approximations, and
Python's own estimate using math.sqrt.

import math
x = float(input("Enter a positive number: "))
tolerance = 0.000001
estimate = 1.0
while True:
 estimate = (estimate + x / estimate) / 2
 difference = abs(x - estimate ** 2)
 if difference <= tolerance:
    break
print("The program's estimate:", estimate)
print("Python's estimate: ", math.sqrt(x))
