Problem:Describe the costs and benefits of aliasing, and explain how it can be avoided

Solution:
Aliasing can make the different signals for becoming in-distinguishable from one another.

Aliasing can be reduced with the help of sampling, which is done at a higher rate than that of the Nyquist rate.

Anti-aliasing technique is being used for eliminating the effect of overlaping of the frequency components.
