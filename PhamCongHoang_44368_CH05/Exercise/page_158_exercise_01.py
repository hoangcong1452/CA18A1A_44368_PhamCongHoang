Problem:Give three examples of real-world objects that behave like a dictionary.

Solution:
1. An object and its shadow are similar since the shapes are exactly the same. It is only the size that varies.
2. An enlarged picture retains the shape of the original picture. It is only the size that varies.
3. All balls are similar because they all have the same shape. Only the size may vary
