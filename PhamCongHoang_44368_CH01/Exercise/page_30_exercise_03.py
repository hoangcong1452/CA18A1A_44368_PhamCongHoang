Problem:
   Why does Python code generate fewer types of syntax errors than code in other
programming languages
Solution:
The definition of logical blocks in Python is done with simple indentations,
that is visual, you do not need to read anything to see the block.
In the aforementioned languages, you must write a block start key and a termination key.
 When there are many nested logical blocks, indentation must be used to display them (and also keys {}).
