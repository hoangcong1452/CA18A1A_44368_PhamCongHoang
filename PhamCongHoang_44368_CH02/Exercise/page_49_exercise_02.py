Problem:Explain the differences between the data types int and float.

Solution:
    Integers and floats are two different kinds of numerical data.
    An integer (more commonly called an int) is a number without a decimal point. A float is a floating-point number,
     which means it is a number that has a decimal place. Floats are used when more precision is needed.
