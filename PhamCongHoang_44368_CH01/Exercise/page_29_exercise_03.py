Problem:
   Answer the question, What is a Python script?
Solution:
    A Python script is a collection of commands in a file designed to be executed like a program.
     The file can of course contain functions and import various modules, but the idea is that it will be
    run or executed from the command line or from within a Python interactive shell to perform a specific task.
