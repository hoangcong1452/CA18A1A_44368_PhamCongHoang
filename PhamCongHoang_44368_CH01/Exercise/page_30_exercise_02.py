Problem:
   Miranda has forgotten to complete an arithmetic expression before the end of a line
of code. How will the Python interpreter react
Solution:
    if an expression is not completely defined then the interpreter will print an error message as
     “invalid syntax”.

    The interpreter checks for syntax errors. It will check for the end of the line
    after the expression before calculating the result and if not found then it returns the error.
