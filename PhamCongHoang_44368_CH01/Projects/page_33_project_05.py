Problem:
   Modify the program of Project 4 to compute the area of a triangle. Issue the
appropriate prompts for the triangleâ€™s base and height, and change the names of
the variables appropriately. Then, use the formula .5 * base * height to compute the area. Test the program from an IDLE window.
Solution:


    ....
"""
base = int(input("chieu dai day:"))
heigh = int(input("chieu cao:"))
area = 0.5*base*heigh
print (" dien tich:", area, )
