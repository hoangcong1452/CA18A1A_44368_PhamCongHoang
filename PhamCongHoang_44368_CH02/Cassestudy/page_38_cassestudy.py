Problem:: Income Tax Calculator
Most of the chapters in this book include a case study that illustrates the software
development process. This approach may seem overly elaborate for small programs,
but it scales up well when programs become larger. The first case study develops a
program that calculates income tax.
Each year, nearly everyone with an income faces the unpleasant task of computing
his or her income tax return. If only it could be done as easily as suggested in this
case study! We start with the customer request phase.
