Problem:Explain how to display help information on a particular function in a given module.

Solution:
    using help in python
    The Python help() function invokes the interactive built-in help system.
     If the argument is a string, then the string is treated as the name of a module, function, class, keyword, or documentation topic, and a help page is printed on the console.
    If the argument is any other kind of object, a help page on the object is displayed.
