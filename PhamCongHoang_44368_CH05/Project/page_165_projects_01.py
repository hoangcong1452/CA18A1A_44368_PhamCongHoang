Problem:
A group of statisticians at a local college has asked you to create a set of functions
that compute the median and mode of a set of numbers, as defined in Section
5.4. Define these functions in a module named stats.py. Also include a function
named mean, which computes the average of a set of numbers. Each function
should expect a list of numbers as an argument and return a single number. Each
function should return 0 if the list is empty. Include a main function that tests the
three statistical functions with a given list

Solution:



"""

info={"name": "sandy", "age":17, "class":"it"}
print(list(info.get("hobbies", none)))
